# Changelog

All notable changes to agentty. Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Frequent `transient — retrying…` banner caused by stale pooled connections.** The dominant trigger for the orange retry banner was a reused h2 connection that Anthropic's edge (or an intermediate proxy) had silently half-closed: the pool's acquire-time liveness checks (`nghttp2` protocol state + a non-blocking `MSG_PEEK`) passed because the FIN/`GOAWAY` was still in flight, so a corpse got handed out. The new stream submitted on it was immediately `RST_STREAM`'d / `GOAWAY`'d — and because the old retry gate (`any_bytes`, set on *headers*) considered a headers-only `:status` block "committed," the HTTP layer couldn't re-dial. The error bubbled to the reducer, which restarted the whole turn loudly with backoff. Two transport-layer fixes: (1) the stream-commit point is now real SSE **DATA** (`on_chunk` with body bytes), not headers — a stream that got only `:status` before the reset is replay-safe and re-dials transparently; (2) a *reused* pooled connection that dies before delivering any data gets up to 2 free fresh re-dials that don't count against the transport attempt budget, so a pool-staleness artifact never surfaces as a user-visible error. Genuine fresh-dial failures and any reset after real content still converge to a terminal error exactly as before. This is what the official Anthropic SDK / Claude Code get for free from undici's managed pool (honor `GOAWAY`, retry transport resets on a fresh connection); agentty now matches it.
- **Transient backoff that never recovered + frequent "stream stalled" after long sessions.** `transient_retries` only reset to 0 on the first content *delta*, so a stream that connected, sent heartbeats, then went silent before any byte (common during brown-outs and long opus turns) climbed the retry ladder every attempt until it hit `kMaxRetries` and latched terminal — the session was dead until restart. Two fixes: (1) a heartbeat (SSE `ping` / `thinking_delta`) now resets the retry budget too, since it proves the wire is alive even pre-content; (2) the budget decays over wall-clock time — if the previous failure was longer ago than `kRetryDecayWindow` (90 s) the connection was healthy in between, so the new failure starts a fresh ladder instead of inheriting an unrelated earlier blip. Net effect: fast-failing connections (refused/reset within 90 s) still converge to terminal at attempt 6, but slow stalls minutes apart recover indefinitely. `Esc` still breaks the loop at any point.

## [0.1.1]

### Added
- `--version` / `-V` / `version` flag — prints `agentty <PROJECT_VERSION>` and exits. The version is baked at build time from `CMakeLists.txt`'s `project(... VERSION ...)` line, so bumping the project version updates every site that reads `AGENTTY_VERSION`.
- Queued messages render as preview rows in the conversation transcript (above the composer), visually identical to real user turns. Mirrors Claude Code 2.1.119's behaviour at binary offset 80106500.
- `↑` (Up-arrow) on an empty composer recalls every queued message back into the buffer, joined by `\n`, with the cursor at the recalled-text seam. Destructive on the queue — re-submit to re-queue. Mirrors Claude Code's `Lc_` (offset 76303220).
- Composer placeholder gains a `press ↑ to edit queued — type to queue another…` hint when the queue is non-empty and the buffer is empty (and matching variants for awaiting/idle phases). Mirrors Claude Code's hint at offset 84591379.
- Retry status now shows attempt counter: `transient — retrying in 5s (attempt 2/6)…`.

### Changed
- **Transport reliability.** Anthropic's `Retry-After` HTTP header is now parsed on 429 / 529 responses and used as the authoritative backoff delay, clamped to `[1s, 120s]`. Falls back to the existing 500ms→45s ladder when no header is present, with ±20% jitter applied to break thundering-herd retry sync during regional brown-outs. Inspired by Zed's `parse_retry_after` (`crates/anthropic/src/anthropic.rs:574-580`).
- **Cancel cleanup.** `Esc` now does the full teardown synchronously: drains `streaming_text` into `text` (preserves partial reply), marks every non-terminal `tool_call` as `Failed("cancelled")`, pops the assistant placeholder if it produced no content, and resets `pending_permission`. No more orphan `Running` spinners or empty placeholder cards after cancel.
- Status banner row replaced by a notification takeover on the existing shortcut row — when `m.s.status` is active, the keybindings strip swaps in a single banner-style entry (`▎⚠ <text>` for errors, `▎ <text>` for info) and reverts to bindings when the toast expires. No new rows added.
- `submit_message` now queues on any non-Idle phase (`m.s.active()`) instead of just `is_streaming() || is_executing_tool()`. Defensive — the keymap already gated `AwaitingPermission` via the permission modal — but makes the guarantee structural.

### Fixed
- **Model / thread / palette pickers felt unresponsive — arrow keys "registered once per 4-5 presses."** The Program render gate (`visual_hash`) didn't include any modal/picker selection state, so moving the cursor (`ModelPickerMove` → `index++`) produced a model the gate considered visually identical and `skip_render` fired; the new cursor position only painted when an unrelated hashed axis (the ~265 ms composer caret-blink parity) happened to flip. `visual_hash` now mixes in every modal's open/closed state plus the active picker's cursor index and filter query, so each keystroke repaints immediately.
- **Picker arrow keys double-dispatched.** The picker `ScrollState`s defaulted to `auto_dispatch = true`, so every ↑/↓/PageUp was fed into `ScrollState::handle` (bumping `scroll.y`) *in addition* to the reducer's selection move — the two then fought the widget's selection-follow clamp. Set `auto_dispatch = false` on all six picker scroll states; scroll position is now a pure function of the selected index.
- **Up-to-100 ms input stall on bare Escape and split escape sequences (maya).** The idle (`fps=0`) event loop slept the full 100 ms poll while the input parser held a partial escape sequence (a lone ESC, or an arrow key whose bytes arrived in separate reads over SSH/tmux/slow ptys) — only `flush_timeout()` could resolve it, and only after the 50 ms escape deadline, but the loop never woke to call it. The loop now clamps its poll timeout to the escape deadline while the parser has pending input (`Runtime::has_pending_input()`). Most visible in the pickers, which idle with no spinner tick to keep the loop spinning.
- **`agentty gets stuck — nothing works` after Esc.** A worker thread's trailing `StreamError("cancelled")`, dispatched ~200 ms after the cancel-token trip, was running on the runtime's `active_ctx`. If the user submitted a new turn during that window, the handler's `a->cancel.reset()` would null out the *new* turn's cancel token, leaving `Esc` unable to cancel anything until process restart. `launch_stream` now wraps `dispatch` in a `guarded` lambda that captures the cancel token and short-circuits when tripped — no events from a cancelled worker reach the reducer, so the new turn's state is never touched.
- Removed the redundant `N messages queued` line from the shortcut row; the composer's own `❚ N queued` chip is now the single source of truth for queue depth.

## [0.1.0] — Initial public release

Pre-1.0. Core loop, tools, streaming, permission profiles, in-app auth, persistence, and cross-platform subprocess all working. Linux gets daily smoke testing; macOS and Windows code paths exist (`#ifdef` branches throughout, `posix_spawn` for POSIX, `CreateProcessW` for Windows, `fdatasync`/`fsync` switched per OS) but CI for those platforms is next.

### Major surfaces

- **Native C++26 TUI** rendering through the `maya` widget engine (sister project, FetchContent-pulled from `1ay1/maya`). Single ~9 MB static binary, no Node / Python / Electron runtime.
- **Anthropic provider** speaking HTTP/2 + SSE directly via in-house `nghttp2` + OpenSSL stack. OAuth (PKCE) + API key both wired through the same `auth::cmd_login` path.
- **Tools**: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `glob`, `list_dir`, `find_definition`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `todo`, `diagnostics`, `git_*`. Compile-time effect set + permission policy enforced via `static_assert` on a `constexpr` matrix.
- **Permission profiles**: `Write` (autonomous), `Ask` (read-only auto, write/exec/net prompt), `Minimal` (only pure tools auto). Profile cycle on `S-Tab`.
- **Sandboxed bash** by default — `bwrap` on Linux, `sandbox-exec` on macOS. Windows runs unsandboxed (no first-class equivalent yet).
- **Workspace boundary**: filesystem tools refuse paths outside `--workspace`/cwd.
- **SSH air-gap mode** (`agentty airgap …`): wraps agentty on a remote host with SOCKS5 forwarding for TLS / OAuth / chat traffic. Compression off by default (small bursty deltas not worth zlib sync overhead on inline frames); env vars for terminal identification forwarded across the SSH boundary so DEC 2026 sync still applies on the remote side.
- **Persistence**: threads and credentials in `~/.agentty/threads/` and `~/.config/agentty/credentials.json` (mode 0600). Atomic writes (temp + fsync + rename).
- **Streaming smoothing**: SSE deltas drip into `streaming_text` at ⅛ buffer per Tick (clamped 32–256 chars), so server-side batching doesn't translate into chunky on-screen text.
- **Inline rendering** — agentty never takes over the terminal; output flows in scrollback, status bar overlays. `compose_inline_frame` wraps frames in DEC 2026 begin/end-sync where supported.

### Stubbed honestly (not yet implemented)

- **Checkpoint restore** — `CheckpointId` + per-message marker exist; `RestoreCheckpoint` surfaces "not implemented yet" and does nothing.
- **Diff review pane** — modal renders, but `pending_changes` isn't populated by any tool yet, so review/accept/reject toasts "no pending changes".

### Build

- C++26 (GCC 14+ / Clang 18+); MSVC builds against `/std:c++latest`.
- AppleClang tops out at C++23 — `AGENTTY_BUILD_TESTS` requires `g++` or stock LLVM `clang++` on macOS, not Xcode's bundled toolchain.
- `cmake -B build && cmake --build build`. `AGENTTY_STANDALONE=ON` produces a static binary (libc and usually OpenSSL stay dynamic).
