// Composer attachments — the bytes that DON'T live inline in
// ComposerState::text. A long paste (or an @file pick) becomes an
// Attachment in the composer's `attachments` vector and a single
// placeholder token `\x01ATT:N\x01` is inserted at the cursor in
// `text`. The view renders the placeholder as a one-line chip; on
// submit the placeholder is substituted with the attachment's body
// so the model sees the literal bytes. Idea & UX directly from
// Cursor / Claude Code: tidy composer, full payload to the wire.
//
// Why a magic placeholder rather than a separate "rich text" model:
//   - Cursor / selection math stays plain-string. utf8_prev / utf8_next
//     just need to recognise the placeholder as a single navigation
//     unit.
//   - Multi-attachment ordering is whatever order they appear in
//     `text`; no parallel index to keep in sync.
//   - Submit-time substitution is a single string replace pass; no
//     special-case for "where does this attachment fit relative to
//     the prose around it."
//
// The placeholder bytes use \x01 (Start-Of-Heading, SOH) as the
// outer delimiter — a C0 control character that practically never
// appears in user-typed text or pastes (the StreamSink scrubs them
// to U+FFFD on the wire). The middle is `ATT:` + decimal index, so
// the whole token is `\x01ATT:0\x01` minimum (8 bytes), variable
// length thereafter.
