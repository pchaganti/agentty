// agentty::util::isolated_thread — a worker thread whose panic can NEVER take
// down the process, and whose lifetime is OWNED (joined), not detached.
//
// The problem this kills (RUST-CRITIQUE.md #3): `std::thread(...).detach()`.
// Detaching means (a) no ownership / no join — the thread outlives every
// handle to it, and (b) an exception that escapes the thread body calls
// std::terminate(), killing EVERY session in the process. The current code
// defends (b) with a giant hand-written try/catch at the top of run_turn; if
// any future edit adds a code path that can throw OUTSIDE that catch, one bad
// turn nukes the whole agent.
//
// Rust's answer is structured: a tokio task / std::thread::scope isolates a
// panic to the one task (panic = unwind, runtime survives) and gives you a
// JoinHandle. We match AND beat it:
//
//   • Exception isolation is STRUCTURAL, not a convention. The thread body is
//     wrapped so that std::terminate is UNREACHABLE — a throwing callable is
//     caught by the double catch here, funnelled to an on_error hook, and the
//     thread exits cleanly. There is no code path from a worker throw to
//     process death, and you can't forget to write the try/catch because the
//     wrapper owns it.
//
//   • Lifetime is OWNED. `isolated_thread` joins in its destructor (like a
//     jthread / scoped thread), so a worker can't outlive the data it
//     borrowed. For the ACP fire-and-forget turn worker we still want the
//     handler to RETURN immediately while the turn runs on — so we provide
//     `run_isolated_detached`, which keeps the SAME terminate-proof wrapper
//     but hands ownership to a self-joining reaper instead of raw detach.
//     Even "detached" work is exception-isolated; that's the improvement.
