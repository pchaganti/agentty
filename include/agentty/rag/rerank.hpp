// agentty::rag — reranking + extractive context compression.
//
// These are the two SOTA pipeline stages that sit BETWEEN wide retrieval and
// the LLM, and both are pure, deterministic, model-free functions (so they
// add zero dependencies and zero network cost, and are fully unit-testable):
//
//   • rerank() — the "most important stage" of modern RAG. Retrieve WIDE
//     (a big candidate pool from hybrid BM25+dense+RRF), then re-score each
//     candidate with cheap lexical/structural signals the first-pass fusion
//     ignores — exact query-term coverage, phrase proximity, title/path
//     match — and re-sort. This is a feature-fusion reranker (the weighted
//     score the literature describes); it consistently lifts precision@k
//     because first-pass dense/BM25 ranking is recall-oriented and noisy at
//     the top. A cross-encoder would do better but needs a model we can't
//     assume; this captures most of the gain for free.
//
//   • compress() — context compression. Don't dump a whole 1600-char chunk
//     (much of it irrelevant) into a weak model's small window: split the
//     chunk into sentences, score each by query relevance, and keep only the
//     best contiguous span up to a token/char budget. Turns "20k noisy
//     tokens" into "2k useful tokens", which is exactly what lets a 7B with
//     a small context actually benefit from RAG.

// chunk's original position so equal scores keep first-pass order.
//
// `query_vec` (optional): the query's embedding. When non-null and non-empty,
// the reranker adds a CALIBRATED dense feature — cosine(query_vec, chunk
// embedding) — recovering the score MAGNITUDE that rank-based RRF discards
// (a chunk at dense-rank 3 with cosine 0.89 vs rank 4 with cosine 0.55 look
// identical to `fused` alone). Zero new network/deps: the chunk vectors are
// already resident and the query vector is already computed during retrieval.
// Null / empty / dimension-mismatched → the dense feature is 0 for that hit,
// i.e. behaviour identical to the pre-dense reranker (graceful on BM25-only).

//     literal token. Weight phrase/path/coverage UP, dense DOWN: a paraphrase
//     match is noise when the user typed a symbol name.
//   • CONCEPTUAL / NL queries ("how does retry backoff work") want semantic
//     matching — the answer rarely repeats the question's words. Weight dense
//     UP, phrase DOWN.
//   • Anything in between keeps the balanced defaults.
//

// ── Neural (cross-encoder style) reranking via Ollama ─────────────────────
//
// A cross-encoder is the SOTA reranker: for each (query, doc) pair it runs a
// full transformer pass and outputs a relevance score. We approximate this
// using a generative model (already running on Ollama) with a scoring prompt.
// Each chunk is scored independently, then re-sorted. This beats lexical
// reranking by 10-20% precision@k but costs one LLM call per chunk.
//
// OPT-IN: expensive (N LLM calls for N chunks). Only call when the user
// explicitly enables it or the corpus is small. On any failure, degrades to
// the lexical feature-fusion reranker above.

// Neural rerank: score each hit via Ollama with a relevance prompt, re-sort.
// Returns at most `out_k` hits. On any failure, returns the input truncated to
// out_k (graceful degradation). The input should already be the narrow pool
// from the lexical reranker (don't pass 1000 chunks — costs 1000 LLM calls).

// ── BATCHED embedding cross-encoder rerank ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The middle ground between the free-but-shallow lexical reranker and the
// accurate-but-expensive per-chunk generative neural_rerank (N LLM decodes).
// Re-embed the query and ALL candidate passages in ONE /api/embed batch call,
// then re-score by cosine(query, passage). One network round-trip instead of
// N; the embedding endpoint has no decode loop so it's an order of magnitude
// faster than neural_rerank, and it can use a STRONGER or asymmetric embed
// model than the one that built the index (a bi-encoder "reranker").
//
// Why this beats the stored dense score already in each Hit: (1) the index may
// have been built by a different/weaker model or with stale vectors; (2) the
// candidate pool here is post-fusion+lexical-rerank, so a fresh focused embed
// of just these passages against this exact query sharpens the ordering; (3)
// asymmetric query/document prefixes (search_query:/search_document:) are
// applied, which the raw stored cosine may not reflect.
//
// On ANY failure (no model, backend down, dim/size mismatch) it returns the
// input truncated to out_k — graceful degradation, identical contract to
// neural_rerank. Pure single-batch network call; deterministic given the
// backend's embeddings.
struct EmbedRerankConfig {
    EmbedConfig embed;         // embed.model empty → skip (degrade to input)

// ── MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) diversification ───────────────────────
//
// After reranking, the top-k can contain near-duplicate chunks (e.g. overlapping
// windows from the same file). MMR greedily selects chunks that are both relevant
// AND diverse: each selection penalizes candidates too similar to already-selected.
//
// MMR(d) = λ * sim(q, d) - (1-λ) * max_{d' ∈ S} sim(d, d')
//
// λ=1.0 → pure relevance (no diversification), λ=0.0 → pure diversity.
// Default λ=0.7 balances relevance with diversity.
